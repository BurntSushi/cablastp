Start actually using the seeds. i.e., start consuming input.

Screw gapped extension for the moment.

Edit scripts will always be empty. That's cool.

Attempt ungapped extension. Take entire match, run Smith-Waterman, and consume
from alignment greedily until end of alignment or sequence identity suffers too 
much.

But try ungapped extension and no gapped extension to get up and running.

Gapped extension is extremely fiddly. Adding extra bases? Truncating? Oh my!
